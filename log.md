**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: Today I went through W3School JS Quiz and JS Exercises

**Thoughts**: Even though I got a bit of a cold I was able to go through the quizes and exerceises effortlessly, it was quite basic lvl stuff. For this 10 days I will be focusing on the fundamentals and basics. I was able to spare 1 hr for coding.
